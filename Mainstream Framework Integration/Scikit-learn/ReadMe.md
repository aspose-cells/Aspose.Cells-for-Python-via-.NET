# Python Machine Learning and Excel Reporting with Scikit-learn and Aspose.Cells

## Overview

**Scikit-learn** (abbreviated as `sklearn`) is an open-source **Machine Learning** library for Python.  

It provides a rich and easy-to-use set of tools for:

- **Classification**  
- **Regression**  
- **Clustering**  
- **Dimensionality Reduction**  
- **Model Selection & Evaluation**  
- **Data Preprocessing**  

Scikit-learn is built on top of **NumPy**, **SciPy**, and **matplotlib**, and is one of the most commonly used Python libraries for machine learning and data analysis.
