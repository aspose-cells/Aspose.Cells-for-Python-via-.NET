# Flask

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework for building websites and web applications. Unlike Django, Flask is minimalistic, giving developers more control and freedom to structure their projects. It is highly extensible and widely used in both small and large web projects.

You can find the source code and contribute to Flask on GitHub: [https://github.com/pallets/flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask)
